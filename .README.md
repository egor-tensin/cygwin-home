My Cygwin home (~) configuration files

To deploy on a fresh Cygwin installation, execute the lines below.
**Be careful** though, some of your files might get **deleted**.
Namely, your `.gitignore` file (if present) will be overwritten and basically
all of your files this repository isn't aware of will be deleted.
Execute the lines below one-by-one and, **most importantly**, review the list
of files `git clean` will delete by adding the `--dry-run` parameter.

    git init
    curl --silent --show-error --location https://github.com/egor-tensin/cygwin_home/raw/master/.gitignore > .gitignore
    git clean -d --force

    git remote add origin git@github.com:egor-tensin/cygwin_home.git
    git pull origin master
    git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master master

The deployment should preferably take place right after you install Cygwin.
